# Logger Formatter

Do you feel tired of warnings "Use the built-in formatting to construct this argument." from Sonarlint? Surely you can deactivate that rule, and sync it across your computer, but your colleagues may not. So why not use this to format all of them?

## Features

## Requirements

There is no requirement to use this extension, but format documents before use are recommended.

## Release Notes

Currently, in beta, so supported packages are very limited.
